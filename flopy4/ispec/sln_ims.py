Norm (absolute convergence criteria). When RELATIVE_RCLOSE is
specified, a reasonable initial INNER_RCLOSE value is $1.0 times
10^{-4}$ and convergence is achieved for a given inner (linear)
iteration when $Delta h le$ INNER_DVCLOSE and the current L-2 Norm is
$le$ the product of the RELATIVE_RCLOSE and the initial L-2 Norm for
the current inner (linear) iteration. If RCLOSE_OPTION is not
